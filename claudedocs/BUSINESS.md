## Investment Plan (Optional)

### Bootstrap Strategy without Fundraising (Recommended)

```
Year 1: Self-funding $5,000-10,000 (if needed)
├─ Development: $0 (founders build)
├─ Infrastructure: $630 (Vercel + Railway + Supabase)
├─ Marketing: $2,000-4,000 (SEO content, minimal ads)
├─ Legal/Tax: $1,000-2,000 (business registration, lawyer consult)
├─ Buffer: $1,000-3,000

End of Year 1:
- Cumulative revenue: $6,035
- ROI: 20-120% (depending on marketing spend)
- Year 2: Fully self-funded from revenue

Strategy:
- Start with minimal investment (<$10K)
- Reinvest revenue into growth
- Stay lean, automate everything
- Delay hiring until Month 13+ and only if revenue justifies
- Profitable from Month 1 due to low costs
```

---

### Fundraising Scenario (Optional - Only if Scaling Aggressively)

**Consider Seed Round at Month 18-24** (only if hitting targets and want to accelerate)

```
Raise: $200,000-300,000
Valuation: $1.5M-2M (pre-money)
Dilution: 15-20%

Use of Funds:
- Team expansion: $100,000-150,000
  * 2 full-time engineers (mobile + backend)
  * 1 full-time growth marketer
  * 1 part-time customer success
  
- Marketing: $60,000-80,000
  * Paid ads (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)
  * Content marketing agency
  * Conference sponsorships
  
- Product Development: $30,000-50,000
  * Mobile app development (outsourced if needed)
  * Advanced features (AI matching, analytics)
  * Infrastructure scaling
  
- Working Capital: $10,000-20,000

Goals with Funding:
- Achieve $100K monthly transactions by Month 30
- 10x growth in 18 months
- Series A readiness ($3-5M raise) by Month 36

When to Fundraise:
- Only if: Monthly revenue >$10K, clear path to $1M ARR
- Reason: Accelerate growth, capture market faster
- Alternative: Stay bootstrapped, grow organically (still viable)
```

**Recommendation**: Bootstrap as long as possible, only raise if organic growth is capital-constrained

### Unit Economics

```
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):
- Companies: $20-30/company (organic SEO + community)
  * SEO content: ~$15/customer (blog posts, guides)
  * Community engagement: ~$5/customer (Reddit, forums)
  * Paid ads (Year 2+): $40-60/customer
  
- Workers: $2-5/person (community referral + organic)
  * Community posts: ~$2/worker
  * Referral program: ~$3/worker (when activated)

LTV (Lifetime Value - 12 months):
- Companies: $200-400/company
  * Average: 15 tasks × $15 avg = $225 transaction volume
  * Commission (after Stripe): $21 per company
  * Typical lifetime: 6-12 months
  * LTV = $21 × 10 tasks = $210
  
- Workers: $30-50/person
  * Average: 8 tasks completed (many try once and leave)
  * Commission generated: $0.95 per task × 8 = $7.60
  * Typical lifetime: 3-6 months
  * Pro workers (top 20%): $150+ LTV

LTV/CAC Ratio:
- Companies: 7-10x (healthy, 3x+ is goal)
  * Conservative: $210 LTV / $30 CAC = 7x
  * Optimistic: $400 LTV / $20 CAC = 20x
  
- Workers: 1.5-5x (marginal but acceptable due to low CAC)
  * Average worker: $7.60 LTV / $5 CAC = 1.5x
  * Pro worker: $150 LTV / $5 CAC = 30x
  * Strategy: Focus retention on high-performers

Payback Period:
- Companies: 1-2 months (recover on 2nd-3rd task)
- Workers: Immediate (low acquisition cost, referral-driven)

Improvement Strategy:
- Increase worker retention from 25% to 40% (Year 1 → Year 2)
- Focus on Pro worker development (higher LTV)
- Reduce company CAC through better SEO and content
```
